# origamid-portfolio
This project was developed during course "HTML e CSS para Iniciantes" from [Origamid](https://www.origamid.com/curso/html-e-css-para-iniciantes/).

This course is an updated version from the former [Curso de Web Design Completo](https://www.origamid.com/curso/web-design-completo).

I was enticed to redo this course despite already being programming for a while to review my basic skills. Mostly about semantic HTML and posisitoning with CSS. It was worth it!
I've reviewed several concepts and learned a lot doing this simple project!

Feel free to use it as a template for your own portfolio!
